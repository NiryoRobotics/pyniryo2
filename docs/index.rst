This documentation presents Ned's PyPi package, which is the second version of the python API Pyniryo for the robots:
Niryo One, Ned and Ned2. It is based on the roslibpy library and allows a more complete programming of the robots.

It offers a simple way for developers to create programs for robot and
to control them via remote communication from their computers.
Contrary to the Python ROS Wrapper, the user will not need to be connected on the robot
through a terminal.
This API is based on `roslibpy <https://roslibpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

.. note:: This package is able to control Ned in simulation
   as well as the physical robot.
